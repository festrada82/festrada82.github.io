  "description": "A compact, bench-top sheet-metal bender/press-brake designed for repeatable small-part fabrication. The assembly is fully parametric in SOLIDWORKS (side plates, hinge, clamping beam, and interchangeable V-dies), with an adjustable back-gauge for consistent flange lengths and quick setup.
