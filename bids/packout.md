# Packout Magazine/Ammo Inserts — Preview

## Notes about the photos

The following photos were taken to dimension an **original, made-to-fit PACKOUT insert design**. Measurements were captured with a **digital caliper**.

In three images you’ll see an **optional** method using **Scotch™ clear double-sided mounting tape** to place a small **3D-printed anchor** on the **inside wall opposite the latch (near the bottom)**. This anchor acts as a **hook/locating feature** where the **interchangeable inserts** (for different magazines) snap in and are retained.

**No drilling or screws are required;** the case is **not permanently modified**. If you later want to use the toolbox for something else, the anchor can be **removed** to restore the case to its original condition.
